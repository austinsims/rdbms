Usage: ./minidbms username [file.sql]

The driver, minidbms, runs the program in interactive mode if given a
username only.  It can also run a file of SQL statements if given the
path as a second argument.  It does not take input from stdin.

If turnin messed up the permissions, minidbms is a shell script;
'chmod +x minidbms' to fix.
